# Multi-Label Classification using Codeforces Platform

Multi-Label Classification using Codeforces Platform
CodeForce is a Programming language Competitive platform where Questions are posted, usually its quite challenging to come up with an approach for solving looking at the description. So, tagging for questions is essential for a better user experience. In this machine learning problem, the final goal is to predict the tag based on the Question's textual description, abbreviated as 'problem statement'.

Goal and Objectives:

1) Conduct Explorary Data Analysis on problem tags to analyse number of tags per question,number of words in tags and number of unigrams and multigrams in the problem statement.

2) Conduct Data Pre-processing on problem statement to convert text data to lower case,remove unicode characters , html tags,stop words removal,lemma and stemming.

3) Run and compare various Machine Learning algorithms(Multi-label Logistic Regression,Multi-label Random Forest Classifier and Bilstm with Embedding layer(DL algorithm))by performing hyper-parameter tuning to calculate precision,recall,f1-score,hamming-loss.
